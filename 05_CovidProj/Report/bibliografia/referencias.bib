%In their study entitled, “An Efficiency Comparison of document Preparation Systems Used in Academic Research and Development,” Markus Knauff and Jelica Nejasmic asked 40 researchers across different disciplines to prepare scholarly texts with either Microsoft Word or LaTeX. They divided these researchers into four categories: 1) Word novices, 2) Word experts, 3) LaTeX novices, and 4) LaTeX experts.
